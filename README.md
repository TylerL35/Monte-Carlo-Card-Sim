Answers question: 

Suppose we have a standard deck of 52 cards, where 26 cards are red and 26 cards are black. One by one, cards will be drawn from the top of the deck until the deck is empty. Before each card is drawn, you will have the opportunity to guess whether the chosen card is either red or black. Afterwards, you will get to see the color of the card drawn and know if your guess was correct or not. Describe a strategy to guess the colors of at least 27 cards correctly and estimate the success rate of this strategy.
